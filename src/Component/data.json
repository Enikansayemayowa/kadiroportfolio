I have a bachealor degree in system Engineering from UNILAG. Early i started creating websites for friends and just for fun as well. Besides web development i also explored c# and other non-web-only languages. This passion has since lasted and lead to my decision of working as a freelance web developer. The succes and fun i have in the job is immense and really keeps that passion burning alive.",
